# REXY
A DALL-E CLONE!!

The project was inspired by the groundbreaking work of OpenAI's DALL-E model, which generates images from textual descriptions.
I was fascinated by the potential of this technology and wanted to create my own version to explore its capabilities.

This application was built using the MERN stack: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and React.js.

Node.js and Express.js provided the backend server and API endpoints.

MongoDB served as our database to store user information and image metadata.

React.js was used to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.

Cloudinary: A cloud-based image storage service.
